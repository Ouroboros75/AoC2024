<TOO SLOW AND TOO RESOURCE INTENSIVE>
- do single input (arbitrary, 0, 1, 2024) 
  <if reasonable time> THEN do it for as many number and for as long as possible (preferably 35 since currently stuck at 40)
  -> save those permanently somewhere
  -> when they come up at "pass" and $(maxPass - pass) <= $maxSavedPass(pass):
        --> add $maxSavedPass(pass) <a.k.a number of stones saved>
        --> remove "pass" from llist ENTIRELY
